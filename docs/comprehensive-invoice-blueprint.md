## Blueprint Configuration

The blueprint is configured in the BDA stack with the following priority order:

2. **Invoice** (AWS standard invoice blueprint)
3. **Water-And-Sewer-Bill** (AWS utility bill blueprint)
4. **Electricity-Bill** (AWS electricity bill blueprint)
5. **Bank-Statement** (For financial documents)

## Usage in Application

### Frontend Display

- **Filterable columns**: Vendor, Amount, Payment Terms, Currency, Category
- **Detailed view modal**: Shows all extracted fields including bank details and meter readings
- **Special data column**: Displays bank account info and meter readings when available

### Data Processing Flow
1. User uploads invoice document
2. S3 triggers EventBridge notification
3. Lambda function invokes BDA with comprehensive blueprint
4. BDA processes document using AI models
5. Extracted data stored in structured JSON format
6. Frontend displays processed results in Review dashboard
